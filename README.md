# Py-Web-Essentials (PWE)

## Goal:

Provide convenient means to access a variety of web APIs (that your grandparents could start using Python).

## Known Issues:

Still in a highly WIP status, currently developed and tested under Python 2.7.x environment (mostly Windows).

## TODO:

* Proper packaging!!!
* [wip] Google Weather API
  ** Discard weather.py and work should be done based on weather2.py (for the efficiency of ElementTree over Minidom)
* [wip] util.py
  ** Add a function to properly convert ET to dict
  ** More generic and abstract is never generic and abstract enough
* Google Url Shortener API
* [wip] Google Maps API Family
  ** Geocode API to be refactored
  ** Others to be added
